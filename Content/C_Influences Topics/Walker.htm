        <p>Aaron Thibeaux "T-Bone" Walker was born in Linden, Texas on May 28, 1910. During his lifetime, especially during the 1940’s and early 1950’s, T-Bone laid down the rules for the electric blues guitar. In an interview with Guitar World magazine, B.B. King says, "T-Bone Walker - man, that was the prettiest sound I ever heard in my life, hearing electric guitar playing single string blues. It seemed to me that every time I got a guitar, the notes that T-Bone and all my other idols played, they weren’t on my guitar. [laughs] Just my luck!"(1)  Walker’s guitar playing was bluesy in a jazz-like way. He crisply articulated notes interspersed with slurs in the manner of a jazz trumpeter. His storming chords were a six string imitation of blaring brass and reeds. Walker played with many of the Big Bands in L.A. during the 1940’s and was first recorded in 1942.  The blues world lost one of its greatest musicians when T-Bone died in L.A. on March 16, 1975.</p>
